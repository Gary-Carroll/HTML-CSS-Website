        <p class="p1 col-10">I attended this all boys national school from 2nd class to 6th class. Located in Bagenalstown, we were able to easily walk to the local library or to the football pitch and had great teachers that were happy to bring us often. At the time, this school had one old computer per classroom so we were not taught much about the use of computers or the internet. This is fortunately not the case any longer, however. Recently the school purchased a large number of Chromebooks for students to use in school to learn about safe and enjoyable use of the internet.</p>

        <p class="p1">I attended this mixed secondary school from 1st to 6th year. This school did have a dedicated computer room, however, the computers were out of date even at that time and the teachers were extremely poor at actually teaching us anything to do with computers because they did not have any real computer knowledge, they were teachers of other subjects that were given this task because the school did not have any real computer science teachers. This was understandable at the time because computer science was not yet a Leaving Cert subject. My Juniort Cert and Leaving Cert results are shown in the tables below. Below these tables is a list of all the awards that I received while in secondary school.</p>

        <p class="p1">I am currently doing a masters in computer science in UCD. I am in the first semester of this 16 month course. I also completed my undergraduate studies in UCD, graduating with a degree in Physics with Astronomy and Space Science. I used the programming language Python for my data analysis and presentation for the physics labs and greatly enjoyed it, leading me to choose computer science for my masters. Whem I am finished this course I will have experience in areas such as Python, C and Java programming, assembly language, HTML, CSS, Javascript.</p>
